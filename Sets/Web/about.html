                <p>We bring real world meme culture and familiar internet personalities to life through minifigure style
                    collectible sets, animated content, and short films. Think iconic moments, exaggerated characters,
                    and cultural references all rebuilt the Bricks way.</p>

                <p>These characters don’t just sit on a shelf. They show up in videos, skits, and short form stories,
                    giving them personalities, backstories, and occasionally questionable life choices. Each release
                    adds another layer to the Bricks universe, turning memes into moments and jokes into collectible
                    experiences.</p>

                <p>Everything is created as an original interpretation, inspired by internet culture but redesigned with
                    a distinct Bricks identity. The goal isn’t to copy the internet it’s to rebuild it, brick by brick,
                    with humor, creativity, and a wink to the audience.</p>

                <p class="impact-statement">Because memes fade.<br>But minifigures live forever.</p>

                <h2>BRICKS ECOSYSTEM OVERVIEW</h2>
                <p>Bricks is a community driven digital ecosystem designed to blend culture, collectibles, and immersive
                    experiences. What began as a meme evolves into a scalable foundation where digital ownership,
                    creativity, and participation come together.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>THE END GOAL</h2>
                <p>The ultimate vision for Bricks is to bring these sets into the physical world. Imagine being able to
                    build the Epstein Island in person or having an Alon minifigure on your desk. The end goal is to
                    make this all a reality, turning verified digital artifacts into tangible, buildable experiences.

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>COMMUNITY & ACCESS</h2>
                <p>The Bricks ecosystem prioritizes its community by offering monthly free NFT releases to thousands of
                    participants. These releases are designed to reward holders and expand the creative universe of
                    Bricks. Soon enough everyone will have the opportunity to represent the Bricks family. Bricks NFTs
                    are made up of some of the most outrageous and memeable minifigures.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>DIGITAL COLLECTIBLES & LIMITED DROPS</h2>
                <p>Bricks NFTs are more than static assets. Each collection is developed with a focus on limited supply,
                    transforming Bricks into living sets that evolve over time. Scarcity, creativity, and storytelling
                    are core to every release.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>BRICKS CITY</h2>
                <p>Bricks City is an immersive experience currently in production. It is envisioned as an interactive
                    environment where digital assets, culture, and community converge. Bricks City serves as a central
                    hub for exploration, future activations, and ecosystem expansion. Imagine a mixture of Roblox and
                    Grand Theft Auto, this is something we are currently producing and one huge part of the Bricks
                    World.</p>

                <h2>ECOSYSTEM PHILOSOPHY</h2>
                <p>The Bricks ecosystem is built brick by brick, emphasizing sustainable growth, community
                    participation, and long term value creation. Every component is designed to layer onto the
                    foundation without compromising accessibility or creativity. Additional features, integrations, and
                    experiences are planned as the ecosystem grows.</p>

                <p>Bricks will take over the whole memecoin space, the craziest project shaped by its community which we
